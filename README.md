# Speedy SPA

Sample project that makes F# and [Hotwire.dev](https://hotwire.dev/) meet!
Since [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) uses a mix of javascript and Web Components it's fairly easy to setup and to make it work!

It's even better if you add web components of your own like [Lit](https://lit.dev) which you can render in the server and let the UI handle all the stuff you need dynamicaly
